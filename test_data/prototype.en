Shortly after his mother's death in 1795, Tucker sailed for
Philadelphia, intending to continue his legal education in the United
States. He briefly considered London for his studies but discarded the
idea, in order to optimize his chances for "political advancement."[5]
After a free-spending time with other Bermudians in the capital city, he
ran out of funds, and proceeded to Williamsburg, Virginia to seek advice
and borrow money from his famous cousin St. George Tucker, a maneuver he
would repeat.[5] He was admitted to the College of William & Mary, where
he studied law under St. George and graduated after two years.[5] Tucker
was pleased to find the academic work undemanding, and his social life
entertaining, as he gained access to the finer homes through his
cousin.[6]

Tucker traveled to New York and Philadelphia and, with letters of
introduction in hand, was able to further acquaint himself with his
adopted country and meet noted leaders, including George Washington and
New York governors John Jay and George Clinton. Despite his enjoyment of
this high society, he returned to Williamsburg and there began a
courtship with Mary Byrd Farley, who was possessed of much charm and
fortune, and to whom he proposed.[3] Though he had initially preferred
to delay the wedding until he was admitted to the bar, he gave in to his
heart's desire, borrowed the needed funds from an uncle, and they
married in April 1797. To help Mary, who was chronically ill with
consumption, Tucker arranged a trip to his old home in Bermuda. The stay
there provided Mary no relief from her illness and confirmed their
desire to be in Virginia. They returned to Williamsburg, setting up
residence, and he began to read for admission to the bar, which was
completed after some procrastination.[7] Except for trips to North
Carolina to collect rents on his wife's property, Tucker avoided work,
attending horse races in Fredericksburg, and frequenting fashionable
watering places with friends and family. He made Thomas Jefferson's
acquaintance at this time. Mary never recovered from her infirmities,
and died childless in 1799.[8]

Mary's death complicated Tucker's facile life, as her estate, though
considerable, was fraught with legal problems. It included a sugar
plantation, thousands of acres of land, and a share in the Dismal Swamp
Company.[9] After a prolonged trip to the sugar plantation in Antigua,
and on to Martinique and Bermuda, he returned to Williamsburg and then
determined his future was in the nearby state capital of Richmond,
Virginia as a practicing attorney. Tucker ultimately succeeded in
salvaging only part of his late wife's fortune.[9]
